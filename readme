2.0 Firstly, I implemented a linked list structure, actually singly, doubly and circled linked list.

2.1 Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
FOLLOW UP
How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

2.2 Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.

2.3 Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node.
EXAMPLE
Input: the node ‘c’ from the linked list a->b->c->d->e
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e
