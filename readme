2.0 Firstly, I implemented a linked list structure, actually singly, doubly and circled linked list.

2.1 Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

2.2 Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.

2.3 Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node.
EXAMPLE
Input: the node ‘c’ from the linked list a->b->c->d->e
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e

2.4 You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1’s digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
EXAMPLE
Input: (3 -> 1 -> 5) + (5 -> 9 -> 2)
Output: 8 -> 0 -> 8

//comments:in the book, it uses recursive adding, as it use a node to represent a linked list, which really has some advantage. GOOD!
