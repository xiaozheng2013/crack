1.1 
	Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?
	comments: here I used a c++ map, but in fact, as it only deals with chars, so a 225 long array is good enough, this array can be a good indicator and is small in size.
	Here in the solution, the second methods didn't use extra datastructure, it uses bit vector, which is very impressive!!

1.2
Write code to reverse a C-Style String (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character )

1.3
Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine An extra copy of the array is not
FOLLOW UP Write the test cases for this method

1.4 Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.

1.5 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’.
